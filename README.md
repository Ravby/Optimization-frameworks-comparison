# Optimization frameworks comparison
This repository contains all of the experiments conducted in the paper **Performance Comparison of Single-Objective Evolutionary Algorithms Implemented in Different Frameworks**

The project has a dependency on the [EARS framework](https://github.com/UM-LPM/EARS).

The main runner file is located [here](https://github.com/Ravby/Optimization-frameworks-comparison/blob/main/EARS%20comparison/EARS-framework-benchmark/src/main/java/si/um/feri/lpm/Main.java).

The results are gathered [here](https://github.com/Ravby/Optimization-frameworks-comparison/tree/main/EARS%20comparison/Rating%20intervals).
