Documentation
=============

.. note::

    We suppose that you already followed the :doc:`/installation` guide. If not, please do so
    before you continue to read this section.

To locally generate the documentation run the following command in the project root folder:

.. code-block:: bash

    poetry run sphinx-build docs/source docs/build/html

You can then view it by opening docs/build/html/index.html in your browser
