Installation
============

Dependencies
------------

pagmo is written in modern C++, and it requires a compiler able to understand
at least C++17. pagmo is currently tested on the following setups:

* GCC 9 on GNU/Linux,
* Clang 11 on OSX,
* MSVC 2017 on Windows.

The officially-supported architectures are 64-bit x86, ARM and PowerPC.

The pagmo C++ library has the following **mandatory** dependencies:

* the `Boost <https://www.boost.org/>`__ C++ libraries (at least version 1.68),
* the `Intel TBB <https://github.com/oneapi-src/oneTBB/>`__ library.

Additionally, pagmo has the following **optional** dependencies:

* `Eigen3 <http://eigen.tuxfamily.org/index.php?title=Main_Page>`__ (which is required
  by some algorithms, e.g., :cpp:class:`pagmo::cmaes`), version 3.3 or later,
* `NLopt <https://nlopt.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`__ (which is required by
  the :cpp:class:`pagmo::nlopt` wrapper), version 2.6 or later,
* `Ipopt <https://projects.coin-or.org/Ipopt>`__ (which is required by
  the :cpp:class:`pagmo::ipopt` wrapper).

Additionally, `CMake <https://cmake.org/>`__ is the build system used by
pagmo and it must also be available when
installing from source (the minimum required version is 3.8).

Packages
--------

pagmo packages are available from a variety
of package managers on several platforms.

Conda
^^^^^

pagmo is available via the `conda <https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/>`__ package manager for Linux, OSX and Windows
thanks to the infrastructure provided by `conda-forge <https://conda-forge.org/>`__.
Two packages are available:

* `pagmo <https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/pagmo>`__, which contains the pagmo shared library,
* `pagmo-devel <https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/pagmo-devel>`__,
  which contains the pagmo headers and the
  CMake support files.

In order to install pagmo via conda, you just need to add ``conda-forge``
to the channels, and then we can immediately install pagmo:

.. code-block:: console

   $ conda config --add channels conda-forge
   $ conda config --set channel_priority strict
   $ conda install pagmo pagmo-devel

The conda packages for pagmo are maintained by the core development team,
and they are regularly updated when new pagmo versions are released.

Please refer to the `conda documentation <https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/>`__ for instructions on how to setup and manage
your conda installation.

Arch Linux
^^^^^^^^^^

pagmo is also available on the `Arch User Repository
<https://aur.archlinux.org>`__ (AUR) in Arch Linux. It is
recommended to use an AUR helper like
`yay <https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/yay/>`__ or
`pikaur <https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/pikaur/>`__ for ease of installation.
See the `AUR helpers <https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/AUR_helpers>`__ page on
the Arch Linux wiki for more info.

.. code-block:: console

    $ yay -S pagmo

FreeBSD
^^^^^^^

A FreeBSD port via `pkg
<https://www.freebsd.org/doc/handbook/pkgng-intro.html>`__ has been created for
pagmo. In order to install pagmo using pkg, execute the following command:

.. code-block:: console

   $ pkg install pagmo2

Homebrew
^^^^^^^^

A `Homebrew <https://brew.sh/>`__ recipe for pagmo is also available. In order to install
pagmo on OSX with Homebrew, it is sufficient to execute the following command:

.. code-block:: console

   $ brew install pagmo

vcpkg
^^^^^

You can download and install pagmo2 using the vcpkg dependency manager:

.. code-block:: console

    $ git clone https://github.com/Microsoft/vcpkg.git
    $ cd vcpkg
    $ ./bootstrap-vcpkg.sh    # add -disableMetrics to opt out of telemetry
    $ ./vcpkg install pagmo2  # or use pagmo2[nlopt] for the NLopt wrappers

Then you may direct cmake or msbuild to use the provided vcpkg toolchain file. Please visit
the `vcpkg build system documentation <https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg>`_ for
details.

The pagmo2 port in vcpkg is kept up to date by Microsoft team members and community
contributors. If the version is out of date, please create an issue or pull
request on the `vcpkg repository <https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg>`_.


Installation from source
------------------------

After making sure the dependencies are installed on your system, you can
download the pagmo source code from the
`GitHub release page <https://github.com/esa/pagmo2/releases>`__. Alternatively,
and if you like living on the bleeding edge, you can get the very latest
version of pagmo via ``git``:

.. code-block:: console

   $ git clone https://github.com/esa/pagmo2.git

We follow the usual PR-based development workflow, thus pagmo's ``master``
branch is normally kept in a working state.

After downloading and/or unpacking pagmo's
source code, go to pagmo's
source tree, create a ``build`` directory and ``cd`` into it. E.g.,
on a Unix-like system:

.. code-block:: console

   $ cd /path/to/pagmo
   $ mkdir build
   $ cd build

Once you are in the ``build`` directory, you must configure your build
using ``cmake``. This will allow you to enable support for optional
dependencies, configure the install destination, etc.

The following options are currently recognised by pagmoâ€™s build system:

* ``PAGMO_BUILD_TESTS``: build the test suite (defaults to ``OFF``),
* ``PAGMO_BUILD_TUTORIALS``: build the C++
  :ref:`tutorials <tutorial>` (defaults to ``OFF``),
* ``PAGMO_WITH_EIGEN3``: enable features depending on `Eigen3 <http://eigen.tuxfamily.org/index.php?title=Main_Page>`__
  (defaults to ``OFF``),
* ``PAGMO_WITH_NLOPT``: enable the `NLopt <https://nlopt.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`__
  wrappers (defaults to ``OFF``),
* ``PAGMO_WITH_IPOPT``: enable the `Ipopt <https://projects.coin-or.org/Ipopt>`__
  wrapper (defaults to ``OFF``).

Additionally, there are various useful CMake variables you can set, such as:

* ``CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE``: the build type (``Release``, ``Debug``, etc.),
  defaults to ``Release``.
* ``CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX``: the path into which pagmo will be installed
  (e.g., this defaults to ``/usr/local`` on Unix-like platforms).
* ``CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH``: additional paths that will be searched by CMake
  when looking for dependencies.

Please consult `CMake's documentation <https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/>`_
for more details about CMake's variables and options.

A typical CMake invocation for pagmo may look something like this:

.. code-block:: console

   $ cmake ../ -DPAGMO_BUILD_TESTS=ON -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=~/.local

That is, we build the test suite and we
will be installing pagmo into our home directory into the ``.local``
subdirectory. If CMake runs without errors, we can then proceed to actually
building pagmo:

.. code-block:: console

   $ cmake --build .

This command will build the pagmo library and, if requested, the test suite.
Next, we can install pagmo with the command:

.. code-block:: console

   $ cmake  --build . --target install

This command will install the pagmo library and header files to
the directory tree indicated by the ``CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX`` variable.

If enabled, the test suite can be executed with the command:

.. code-block:: console

   $ cmake  --build . --target test

.. note::

   On Windows, in order to execute the test suite you have to ensure that the
   ``PATH`` variable includes the directory that contains the pagmo
   DLL (otherwise the tests will fail to run).
