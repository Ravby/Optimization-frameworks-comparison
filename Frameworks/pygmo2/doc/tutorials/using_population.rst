Use of the class :class:`~pygmo.population`
================================================

.. image:: ../images/pop_no_text.png

In pygmo, a :class:`~pygmo.population` is a storage for candidate solutions
to some :class:`~pygmo.problem` (sometimes called individuals).
It thus contains a :class:`~pygmo.problem` and a number of decision
vectors (chromosomes) and fitness vectors, each associated to a unique ID as
to allow some degree of tracking.

.. doctest::

    >>> import pygmo as pg
    >>> prob = pg.problem(pg.rosenbrock(dim = 4))
    >>> pop1 = pg.population(prob)
    >>> pop2 = pg.population(prob, size = 5, seed= 723782378)

In the code above, after the trivial import of the pygmo package, we first define a :class:`~pygmo.problem`
from :class:`~pygmo.rosenbrock`, and then we construct two populations (i.e. two sets of candidate solutions).
The first population, ``pop1``, is empty, while the second population is initialized with
five candidate solutions, hence also causing five fitness evaluations. The candidate solutions in
``pop2`` are randomly created within the box-bounds of the :class:`~pygmo.problem` using
the random seed passed as kwarg.

.. doctest::

    >>> print(len(pop1))
    0
    >>> print(pop1.problem.get_fevals())
    0
    >>> print(len(pop2))
    5
    >>> print(pop2.problem.get_fevals())
    5

The full inspection of a :class:`~pygmo.population` is possible, as usual,
via its methods or glancing to the screen print of the entire class:

.. doctest::

    >>> print(pop2) #doctest: +SKIP
    ...
    <BLANKLINE>
    List of individuals:
    #0:

    	Fitness vector:		[121365]

    	Fitness vector:		[487030]

Individuals, i.e. new candidate solutions can be put into a population calling
its :func:`~pygmo.population.push_back()` method:

.. doctest::

    >>> pop1.push_back(x = [0.1,0.2,0.3,0.4]) # correct size
    >>> len(pop1) == 1
    True
    >>> pop1.problem.get_fevals() == 1
    True
    >>> pop1.push_back(x = [0.1,0.2,0.3]) # wrong size
    Traceback (most recent call last):
      File ".../lib/python3.6/doctest.py", line 1330, in __run
        compileflags, 1), test.globs)
      File "<doctest default[3]>", line 1, in <module>
        pop1.push_back([0.1,0.2,0.3])
    ValueError:
    function: check_decision_vector
    where: /Users/darioizzo/Documents/pagmo2/include/pagmo/problem.hpp, 1835
    what: Length of decision vector is 3, should be 4

Some consistency checks are done by :func:`~pygmo.population.push_back()`, e.g. on the decision vector
length.

.. note:: Decision vectors that are outside of the box bounds are allowed to be
          pushed back into a population

The snippet above will trigger fitness function evaluations as the decision vector is always associated to a
fitness vector in a :class:`~pygmo.population`. If the fitness vector associated to a chromosome is known,
you may still push it back in a population and avoid triggering a fitness re-evaluation by typing:

    >>> pop1.push_back(x = [0.2,0.3,1.3,0.2], f = [11.2]) 
    >>> len(pop1) == 2
    True
    >>> pop1.problem.get_fevals() == 1
    True

When designing user-defined algorithms (UDAs) it is often important to be able to change
some individual decision vector:

.. doctest::

    >>> pop1.problem.get_fevals() == 1
    True
    >>> print(pop1.get_x()[0]) # doctest: +NORMALIZE_WHITESPACE
    [0.1  0.2  0.3  0.4]
    >>> pop1.set_x(0, [1.,2.,3.,4.])
    >>> pop1.problem.get_fevals() == 2
    True
    >>> print(pop1.get_f()[0])
    [2705.]
    >>> pop1.set_xf(0, [1.,2.,3.,4.], [8.43469444])
    >>> pop1.problem.get_fevals() == 2
    True
    >>> print(pop1.get_f()[0])
    [8.43469444]

.. note:: Using the method :func:`~pygmo.population.set_xf()` or:func:`~pygmo.population.push_back()` it is possible to avoid
          triggering fitness function evaluations, but it is also possible to inject
          spurious information into the population (i.e. breaking the relation between
          decision vectors and fitness vectors imposed by the problem)

The best individual in a population can be extracted as:

.. doctest::

    >>> # The decision vector
    >>> pop1.get_x()[pop1.best_idx()] # doctest: +NORMALIZE_WHITESPACE
    array([1.,  2.,  3.,  4.])
    >>> # The fitness vector
    >>> pop1.get_f()[pop1.best_idx()]
    array([8.43469444])

The best individual that ever lived in a population, i.e. the *champion* can also be extracted as:

.. doctest::

    >>> # The decision vector
    >>> pop1.champion_x # doctest: +NORMALIZE_WHITESPACE
    array([1.,  2.,  3.,  4.]) 
    >>> # The fitness vector
    >>> pop1.champion_f
    array([8.43469444])

.. note:: The *champion* is not necessarily identical to the best individual in the current population
          as it actually keeps the memory of all past individuals that were at some point in the population
