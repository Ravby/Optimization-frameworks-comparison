.. _py_tutorial_nlopt_basics:

A first tutorial on the use of NLopt solvers
--------------------------------------------

In this tutorial we show the basic usage pattern of :class:`pygmo.nlopt`. This user defined
algorithm (UDA) wraps the NLopt library making it easily accessible via the pygmo common
:class:`pygmo.algorithm` interface. Let us see how this miracle occurs.

I have the gradient
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. doctest::
   
    >>> import pygmo as pg
    >>> uda = pg.nlopt("slsqp")
    >>> algo = pg.algorithm(uda)
    >>> print(algo) # doctest: +NORMALIZE_WHITESPACE +ELLIPSIS

In a few lines we have constructed a :class:`pygmo.algorithm` containing the ``"slsqp"`` solver from
NLopt. For a list of solvers availbale via the NLopt library check the docs of :class:`~pygmo.nlopt`.
In this tutorial we will make use of ``"slsqp"``, a Sequential Quadratic Programming algorithm suited for
generic Non Linear Programming problems (i.e. non linearly constrained single objective problems).

All the stopping criteria used by the NLopt library are available via dedicated attributes, so that we may, for
example, set the ``ftol_rel`` by writing:

.. doctest::
   
    >>> algo.extract(pg.nlopt).ftol_rel = 1e-8

Let us algo activate some verbosity as to store a log and have a screen output:

.. doctest::
   
    >>> algo.set_verbosity(1)

We now need a problem to solve. Let us start with one of the UDPs provided in pygmo. The
:class:`pygmo.luksan_vlcek1` problem is a classic, scalable, equality-constrained problem. It
also has its gradient implemented so that we do not have to worry about that for the moment.

.. doctest::
   
    >>> udp = pg.luksan_vlcek1(dim = 20)
    >>> prob = pg.problem(udp)
    >>> pop = pg.population(prob, size = 1)
    >>> pop.problem.c_tol = [1e-8] * prob.get_nc()

The lines above can be shortened and are equivalent to:

.. doctest::
   
    >>> pop = pg.population(pg.luksan_vlcek1(dim = 20), size = 1)
    >>> pop.problem.c_tol = [1e-8] * pop.problem.get_nc()

We now solve this problem by writing:

.. doctest::
   
   >>> pop = algo.evolve(pop) # doctest: +SKIP

As usual we can access the values in the log to analyze the algorithm performance and, for example, produce a plot such as that
shown here.

.. doctest::

   >>> log = algo.extract(pg.nlopt).get_log()
   >>> from matplotlib import pyplot as plt # doctest: +SKIP
   >>> plt.semilogy([line[0] for line in log], [line[1] for line in log], label = "obj") # doctest: +SKIP
   >>> plt.semilogy([line[0] for line in log], [line[3] for line in log], label = "con") # doctest: +SKIP
   >>> plt.xlabel("objevals") # doctest: +SKIP
   >>> plt.ylabel("value") # doctest: +SKIP
   >>> plt.show() # doctest: +SKIP

I do not have the gradient
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The example above made use of an UDP, :class:`pygmo.luksan_vlcek1`, that provides also explicit gradients for both the objective and the constraints.
In many cases this is not the case for UDPs the user may code in a hurry or that are just too complex to allow explicit gradient computations. Let's see
an example:

.. doctest::

    >>> class my_udp:
    ...     def fitness(self, x):
    ...         return (np.sin(x[0]+x[1]-x[2]), x[0] + np.cos(x[2]*x[1]), x[2])
    ...     def get_bounds(self):
    ...         return ([-1,-1,-1],[1,1,1])
    ...     def get_nec(self):
    ...         return 1
    ...     def get_nic(self):
    ...         return 1
    >>> import numpy as np
    >>> pop = pg.population(prob = my_udp(), size = 1)
    >>> pop = algo.evolve(pop)
    Traceback (most recent call last):
      File "/home/dario/miniconda3/envs/pagmo/lib/python3.6/doctest.py", line 1330, in __run
        compileflags, 1), test.globs)
      File "<doctest default[3]>", line 1, in <module>
        pop = algo.evolve(pop)

    what: during an optimization with the NLopt algorithm 'slsqp' a fitness gradient was requested, but the optimisation problem '<class 'my_udp'>' does not provide it

Bummer! How can I possibly provide a gradient for such a difficult expression of the fitness? Clearly making the derivatives here is not an option :)
Fortunately pygmo provides some utilities to perform numerical differentiation. In particular :func:`pygmo.estimate_gradient()` and :func:`pygmo.estimate_gradient_h()`
can be used quite straight forwardly. The difference between the two is in the finite difference formula used to estimate numerically the gradient, the little ``_h``
standing for high-fidelity (a formula accurate to the sixth order is used: see the docs). So all we need to do, then, is to provide the gradients in our UDP:

.. doctest::

    >>> class my_udp:
    ...     def fitness(self, x):
    ...         return (np.sin(x[0]+x[1]-x[2]), x[0] + np.cos(x[2]*x[1]), x[2])
    ...     def get_bounds(self):
    ...         return ([-1,-1,-1],[1,1,1])
    ...     def get_nec(self):
    ...         return 1
    ...     def get_nic(self):
    ...         return 1
    ...     def gradient(self, x):
    ...         return pg.estimate_gradient_h(lambda x: self.fitness(x), x)
    >>> pop = pg.population(prob = my_udp(), size = 1)
    >>> pop = algo.evolve(pop) # doctest: +SKIP
    fevals:       fitness:      violated:    viol. norm:
          1       0.694978              2        1.92759 i
          2       -0.97723              1    9.87066e-05 i
          3      -0.999189              1     0.00295056 i
          4             -1              1     3.2815e-05 i
          5             -1              1    1.11149e-08 i
          6             -1              1    8.12683e-14 i
          7             -1              0              0

Let's assess the cost of this optimization in terms of calls to the various functions:

.. doctest::

    >>> pop.problem.get_fevals() # doctest: +SKIP
    23
    >>> pop.problem.get_gevals() # doctest: +SKIP
    21

The :func:`pygmo.problem.fitness()` was called a total of 23 times, while :func:`pygmo.problem.gradient()` a total of 21 times. Since we are using
:func:`pygmo.estimate_gradient_h()` to provide the gradient numerically, each call to the :func:`pygmo.problem.gradient()`
causes 6 evaluations of ``my_udp.fitness()``. So, at the end a total of 23 + 6 * 21 calls to ``my_udp.fitness()`` have been made.
