Comparing algorithms: the case of xNES and CMA-ES
=================================================

In this tutorial we will show how to use pygmo to comapre the performances of two UDAs. We lay down a standard
procedure which is to be considered the best practice to perfrom comaprisons and should be used when possible, that
is when algorithms have well defined exit conditions.

We take the case of the two UDAs :class:`~pygmo.cmaes` and :class:`~pygmo.xnes`.

Both algorithms are based on the idea of updating a gaussian distribution that regulates the generation
of new samples, but they differ from the update rules, the ones of xNES being arguably more elegant
and surely more compact.

In order to compare the algorithms we use the experimental cumulative distribution function (ECDF) describing
the probability of finding a solution with an objective function smaller than some ``target``
within a certain budget of function evaluations. Estimating such a ECDF can be done using the results from
calling the ``evolve()`` method of the algorithm a number of times (``trials``) and assembling the results in single runs 
containing multiple restarts.

The results clearly show how CMA-ES is, on these three problems considered, outperforming consistently xNES. 

The plots can be obtained by running the script below, where the population size and the udp are properly defined.
