Solving the 20 dimensional Schwefel problem
===============================================

In this tutorial we will be using many different algorithms to solve the 20 dimensional version
of the Schwefel problem. Such an UDP is coded in the class :class:`~pygmo.schwefel`. The result of the script is the plot 
on the right which is to be produced in a few seconds and that reports the average over 25 runs of some of
the default instances of selected pygmo solvers. The remaining plots shows some single repetitions of the two most successfull algorithms
